# Miners Guide ⛏️

---

SN94 is a subnet that incentivizes the DEVELOPMENT of robust models and architectures for general AI and embodied AI, not the SUPPLY of compute power.

## System Requirements

* OpenAI or other LLM service providers, or local vLLM/SGLang deployment.
* Recommended for developing your own advanced miners:
    - A memory layer storage solution like [Chroma DB](https://www.trychroma.com/).
    - Suitable tools like [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain) to build a stronger "AI OS". To survive in Eastworld and achieve a high score, using good models and prompting techniques alone is not enough.


## Running on Testnet

*Always test your miner on Testnet #288 first*

This project currently provides two demonstration miners. You can run them on the testnet to see how things work:

- Wander Miner: `neurons.miner.WanderAgent` moves in a random direction based on LiDAR signal weights.
- Junior Miner: `eastworld.miner.junior.JuniorAgent` is a basic ReAct agent that explores Eastworld. With a text/log-based memory system, it can handle resource collection and quest submission tasks.
- Miner with Reasoning Models: `eastworld.miner.reasoning.ReasoningAgent` implements an asynchronous reflection architecture, effectively avoiding 20s timeout in the validation requests while leveraging the capabilities of reasoning models.
- Senior Miner: `eastworld.miner.senior.SeniorAgent` provides a modular framework combining SLAM navigation and cognitive agent architecture. Built on LangGraph, it supports flexible structure expansion and on-demand function modularity through its graph-based orchestration layer.

Read the [Agent Development Reference](agent_dev.md) to learn more.

### Installation

#### 1. Prepare the code and environment

```
git clone https://github.com/Eastworld-AI/eastworld-subnet
cd eastworld-subnet

# Recommanded: Use uv to manage packages
uv venv .venv
uv sync --inexact
uv pip install -e .

# Or use pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

```

#### 2. Bittensor wallet and Testnet 

Create your Bittensor wallet. Then, apply for testnet TAO in this [Discord Post](https://discord.com/channels/799672011265015819/1331693251589312553), which is required for miner registration. You may also checkout the [Official FAQ](https://discord.com/channels/799672011265015819/1215386737661055056).


#### 3. Register a miner

After obtaining your testnet TAO, you can register your miner for the testnet:

```
btcli subnets register --network test --netuid 288
```


#### 4. Start the miner and explore

```
# Don't forget to set your LLM credential
# export OPENAI_BASE_URL= OPENAI_API_KEY=
# or put them in the .env file

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

python neurons/miner.py --subtensor.network test --netuid 288 --wallet.name YOUR_WALLET_NAME --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY_NAME --logging.debug --axon.port LOCAL_PORT  --axon.external_port EXTERNAL_PORT --axon.external_ip EXTERNAL_IP

```
Ensure the external endpoint is accessible(`curl` the ip:port from a different host) by the validators and that there are no error logs. Soon, you will start receiving synapses.

##### Running with vLLM or SGLang

When deploying with local vLLM or SGLang:

- Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to your OpenAI compatible server

- Specify the model using `--eastworld.llm_model`


#### 5. Next

Join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/QbkDMwpGzG) to share your thoughts with us and other miners. And DON'T FORGET there's a 24x7 LIVE stream for Eastworld Subnet! You can watch your miner in action in the Eastworld environment. The default stream cycles through all miners, but we can help configure the livestream to stay focused on your miner for debugging. (The mainnet stream will always cycle to prevent cheating).


## Running on Mainnet

To run a miner on mainnet, the procedure is basically the same. First register on SN94:

```
btcli subnets register --netuid 94
```

After the installation, you can run the miner with PM2:

```
# Install NodeJS if it's not already installed
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
fnm use --install-if-missing 22

# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start the miner
pm2 start python -- neurons/miner.py --netuid 94 *The remaining parameters*

```


## Miner Development

In summary, the miner's task is to develop an agent that lives in a virtual world and gets high scores by exploring and completing quests. Just like a video game or MMORPG, but for AI.

Check the [Agent Development Reference](agent_dev.md).


## Score and Incentives

The scoring framework is currently undergoing iterative refinement. The weighted scoring model consists of three primary components:

* **Action Score** – Awarded for each valid individual action. Designed as a frequent, low-value incentive.

* **Explorer Score** – Granted for visiting previously uncharted areas, encouraging agents to explore diverse territories. Area records reset every 24 hours in hourly rolling windows.

* **Quest Score** (Macro Rewards) – Granted for completing coherent sequences of actions, reflecting the quality of strategic planning and providing higher-value rewards.

*Incorrect or repeated invalid actions may result in penalty deductions.*

### Online Leaderboard

* [Mainnet SN94](https://eastworld.grafana.net/public-dashboards/45a641f0908d4ddc835099412ad533be)

* [Testnet tSN288](https://eastworld.grafana.net/public-dashboards/4f1d6f61166c4bfaa8892c5c1688a1f4)


### Score Formula

$\text{Weighted Score} = 0.15 \times \text{Action Score} + 0.15 \times \text{Explorer Score} + 0.7 \times \text{Quest Score}$


### Score Decay

* Action Score: Fixed-point hourly deduction (100)

* Explorer Score: Fixed-point hourly deduction (100)

* Quest Score: Exponential hourly decay (0.9)


### Simulation

 *(Outdated but keep here for reference)*

In our simulation, the general new miner requires ≈40 operational hours to reach mean score level. And it takes 24-hour to restore after a 2-hour outage.
